# angular-training
Codes of the Angular Training of Alura.

The codes are in Portuguese PT-BR (variable and function names, etc) since the original training is in PT-BR. They are over-commented (with comments in PT-BR, EN, and both) since I intend to use them as reference guides when needed.

All projects were developed in WebStorm IDE.
